Understanding Career Transitions
--------------------------------

Career transitions involve moving from one job or industry to another, or making significant changes within your current organization. Here are some common types of career transitions:

* **Changing Industries:** Moving from one industry to another requires you to learn new skills, adapt to different work cultures, and build a network in the new field.

* **Switching Roles:** Transitioning from one role to another within the same industry may involve acquiring additional knowledge, developing new skills, or adjusting to different responsibilities.

* **Entrepreneurship:** Starting your own business or becoming self-employed involves transitioning from an employee to a business owner, requiring a different set of skills and mindset.

* **Returning to Work:** Transitioning back into the workforce after a career break or sabbatical requires reacclimating to the professional environment, updating skills, and rebuilding your network.
